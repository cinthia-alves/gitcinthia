- 👋 Hi, I’m Cinthia Alves (@gitcinthia)

- 🌱 I have experience in Molecular Biology techniques with a huge interesting in computer science area. Currently, I focus my studies on Data Science (DS), Data Visualization (using Power BI and Google Data Studio softwares) and Machine Learning (ML) to become a professional with abilities to move through biology, immunolgy and technology fields.

- 👀 Curriculum Summary: Bachelor in Biomedical Science (C.U. Barão de Mauá, Brazil-2010), MSc. in Basic and Applied Immunology (USP, Brazil-2016) and PhD in Genetics (USP, Brazil-2021), with experience in HLA genomic polymorphims (SNVs/SNPs) studies; and Structural Bioinformatics, with expertise in protein and nucleic acid modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation.

- 💞️ Here you will find protein-DNA molecular dynamic simulation scripts (GROMACs) and python notebooks from my DS and ML studies (UNDER CONSTRUCTION).
